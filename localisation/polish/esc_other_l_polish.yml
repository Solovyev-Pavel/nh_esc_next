### Machines learn about psionics
esc_special_projects.1001.name: "Organics Display Strange Abilities"
esc_special_projects.1001.desc: "A number of organics existing within our sphere of influence are displaying strange abilities. An investigation into the phenomenon reveals that these abilities are collectively referred to as §MPsionics§! and represent a form of thought-driven energy manipulation. Our $job_calculator$ drones think that these abilities can be refined and turned into a viable weapon for our fleets. Shall they be given a go-ahead with this research avenue?"
esc_special_projects.1001.a: "We must learn all that we can about this!"
esc_special_projects.1001.b: "We have better things to research"

ESC_MACHINE_EMPIRE_PSIONICS: "What is §MPsionics§!?"
ESC_MACHINE_EMPIRE_PSIONICS_DESC: "We must research these strange abilities - §MPsionics§! - that a number of organics within our sphere of influence display. The Guiding Intelligence believes that thought-driven energy manipulation that lays at the core of §MPsionic§! abilities can be refined and turned into viable weapon that can be used by our fleets. Such weapons that seemingly defy known laws of physics, should they prove to be possible, will give us a considerable advantage against our foes."

esc_special_projects.1002.name: "§MPsionics§! Research Complete!"
esc_special_projects.1002.desc: "After much research and experimentation, our $job_calculator$ drones were able to find a way to control and enhance §MPsionic§! abilities displayed by organics. This should allow us to create weapons for our ships that have unique properties such as an ability to penetrate seemingly endless number of armor layers. §MPsionic§! weapons, however, come with the downside of requiring a number of organics aboard to function and a substance known as £sr_zro£ §Y$sr_zro$§! in order to maximize potency their abilities."

### Automated Dreadnought computers
esc_special_projects.2002.name: "Automated Dreadnought Observation: Suggestion"
esc_special_projects.2002.desc: "Automated Dreadnought is a fascinating piece of precursor technology and while it doesn't look like it will let us study its design up close, we can still learn a lot by observing its movements as it forever patrols the system. Perhaps, if we can replicate the logic behind its combat computers, it can be applied to our own ships, greatly boosting their abilities."
esc_special_projects.2002.option.a: "We will learn what we can"
esc_special_projects.2002.option.b: "We don't need to copy from this piece of junk!"

ESC_DREADNOUGHT_OBSERVATION: "Automated Dreadnought Observation"
ESC_DREADNOUGHT_OBSERVATION_DESC: "While it doesn't look like combat systems of the ancient Automated Dreadnought possess any form of true intelligence, they are still extremely advanced and if we can replicate their logic for out own ships, this will without a doubt greatly increase strength of our fleets."

esc_special_projects.2003.name: "Automated Dreadnought Obervation: Report"
esc_special_projects.2003.desc: "With the data our observation team has collected on the Automated Dreadnought and its combat behavior, our science department is positive that they will be able to replicate at least some of apparent logic behing its combat computers, adapted to our own ship designs, of course."

### Nanite Thought Matrix computers
esc_special_projects.3002.name: "Nanite Thought Matrix Development"
esc_special_projects.3002.desc: "With our advancements in the fields of nanotechnology and AI some of scientists began contemplating the creation of next generation of AI, one that run on nanite substrate and are capable of mimicing organic minds to an unprecedent degree. Our navy has already expressed interest in adopting such AI for fleet command and are willing to sponsor the research."
esc_special_projects.3002.option.a: "Give researchers a go ahead"
esc_special_projects.3002.option.b: "We have no need of such technology!"

ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_DEVELOP: "Nanite Thought Matrix Development"
ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_DEVELOP_DESC: "According to some research, an AI running on nanite substrate can be made to perfectly replicate organic thought processes, except with incredible speed and precision of a machine. Such AI, should it ever be developed, would revolutionize many fields, and the admiralty board has displayed a great interest in adopting such AI for the purposes of space warfare. They say that having such an AI on our ships will give them a significant edge over our enemies who are still using simplistic and outdated AI."

esc_special_projects.3003.name: "Intact Tempest Ship Recovered"
esc_special_projects.3003.desc: "Following a recent battle, we were able to recover a mostly-intact ship belonging to an extragalctic threat known as the Gray Tempest. The preliminary report of our scientists indicates that the ship was controlled by an AI running on a nanite substrate set to mimic an organic mind of some long-extict species. According to the same report, we might be able to replicate the technology behind this advanced AI and use it to improve combat capabilities of our own ships."
esc_special_projects.3003.option.a: "Give researchers a go ahead"
esc_special_projects.3003.option.b: "We have no need of such technology!"

ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_RENGINEER: "Nanite Thought Matrix Reverse Engineering"
ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_RENGINEER_DESC: "Having recovered a mostly-intact Tempest ship, our scientists have discovered that they are controlled by an advanced form of AI running on a nanite substrate set to mimic an organic mind of some long-extinct species. Having witnessed the power of those ships, it is only natural that we want to copy it for our own fleets."

esc_special_projects.3004.name: "Nanite Thought Matrix"
esc_special_projects.3004.desc: "Our researchers have successfully developed the necessary technologies to create a nanite-based AI with abilities to perfectly mimic organic minds. This breakthrough marks the dawn of a new era in our technological development."

### Gigapredator Instincts computers

esc_special_projects.4002.desc: "We have recently come in contact spaceborn lifeforms unlike anything we've seen before. The creatures of immense scale and, undoubtedly, immense appetite. These giant must utilize some unorthodox physiological tricks and food hunting strategies to survive and thrive. If we can learn and replicate those, perhaps, new and more powerful phenotypes of our own warbeasts will become possible."
esc_special_projects.4002.option.a: "We will learn what we can"
esc_special_projects.4002.option.b: "We don't want our warbeasts to turn on us!"

ESC_GIGAPREDATOR_STUDY: "Gigapredator Study"
ESC_GIGAPREDATOR_STUDY_DESC: "Specaborn leviathans utilize some really unusual biological and behavioral adaptations to survive even in areas of space where, by all accounts, there should not be enough food to sustain their immense bulk. By studying these adaptations, we can learn how to further empower warbeasts under our own command."

esc_special_projects.4003.name: "Gigapredator Study: Report"
esc_special_projects.4003.desc: "Our researchers managed to uncover some of the secrets behind the mechanics that allow survival of the leviathan creatures in the void of space. They are also positive that the gained knowledge can be applied to the lesser creatures, such as our own warbeasts. This should allow creation of stronger and smarter phenotypes, greatly increasing he power of our fleets."
