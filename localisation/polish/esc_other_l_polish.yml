### Machines learn about psionics
esc_special_projects.1001.name: "Organics Display Strange Abilities"
esc_special_projects.1001.desc: "A number of organics existing within our sphere of influence are displaying strange abilities. An investigation into the phenomenon reveals that these abilities are collectively referred to as §MPsionics§! and represent a form of thought-driven energy manipulation. Our $job_calculator$ drones think that these abilities can be refined and turned into a viable weapon for our fleets. Shall they be given a go-ahead with this research avenue?"
esc_special_projects.1001.a: "We must learn all that we can about this!"
esc_special_projects.1001.b: "We have better things to research"

ESC_MACHINE_EMPIRE_PSIONICS: "What is §MPsionics§!?"
ESC_MACHINE_EMPIRE_PSIONICS_DESC: "We must research these strange abilities - §MPsionics§! - that a number of organics within our sphere of influence display. The Guiding Intelligence believes that thought-driven energy manipulation that lays at the core of §MPsionic§! abilities can be refined and turned into viable weapon that can be used by our fleets. Such weapons that seemingly defy known laws of physics, should they prove to be possible, will give us a considerable advantage against our foes."

esc_special_projects.1002.name: "§MPsionics§! Research Complete!"
esc_special_projects.1002.desc: "After much research and experimentation, our $job_calculator$ drones were able to find a way to control and enhance §MPsionic§! abilities displayed by organics. This should allow us to create weapons for our ships that have unique properties such as an ability to penetrate seemingly endless number of armor layers. §MPsionic§! weapons, however, come with the downside of requiring a number of organics aboard to function and a substance known as £sr_zro£ §Y$sr_zro$§! in order to maximize potency their abilities."

Such AI, should it ever be developed, would revolutionize many fields, and the admiralty board has displayed a great interest in adopting such AI for the purposes of space warfare. They say that having such an AI on our ships will give them a significant edge over our enemies who are still using simplistic and outdated AI."

esc_special_projects.3003.name: "Intact Tempest Ship Recovered"
esc_special_projects.3003.desc: "Following a recent battle, we were able to recover a mostly-intact ship belonging to an extragalctic threat known as the Gray Tempest. The preliminary report of our scientists indicates that the ship was controlled by an AI running on a nanite substrate set to mimic an organic mind of some long-extict species. According to the same report, we might be able to replicate the technology behind this advanced AI and use it to improve combat capabilities of our own ships."
esc_special_projects.3003.option.a: "Give researchers a go ahead"
esc_special_projects.3003.option.b: "We have no need of such technology!"

ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_RENGINEER: "Nanite Thought Matrix Reverse Engineering"
ESC_NANITE_THOUGHT_MATRIX_RENGINEER_DESC: "Having recovered a mostly-intact Tempest ship, our scientists have discovered that they are controlled by an advanced form of AI running on a nanite substrate set to mimic an organic mind of some long-extinct species. Having witnessed the power of those ships, it is only natural that we want to copy it for our own fleets."

esc_special_projects.3004.name: "Nanite Thought Matrix"

If we can learn and replicate those, perhaps, new and more powerful phenotypes of our own warbeasts will become possible."
esc_special_projects.4002.option.a: "We will learn what we can"
esc_special_projects.4002.option.b: "We don't want our warbeasts to turn on us!"

ESC_GIGAPREDATOR_STUDY: "Gigapredator Study"
ESC_GIGAPREDATOR_STUDY_DESC: "Specaborn leviathans utilize some really unusual biological and behavioral adaptations to survive even in areas of space where, by all accounts, there should not be enough food to sustain their immense bulk. By studying these adaptations, we can learn how to further empower warbeasts under our own command."

esc_special_projects.4003.name: "Gigapredator Study: Report"
esc_special_projects.4003.desc: "Our researchers managed to uncover some of the secrets behind the mechanics that allow survival of the leviathan creatures in the void of space. They are also positive that the gained knowledge can be applied to the lesser creatures, such as our own warbeasts. This should allow creation of stronger and smarter phenotypes, greatly increasing he power of our fleets."

esc_events.3051.desc: "Mantle Mining Facility on §Y[Root.GetName]§! reports a fascinating discovery made during the operations. A corpse of a giant lifeform unlike anything we've ever seen before was found floating within the planet's mantle, somehow intact despite immense pressure and heat surrounding it.\n\nAccording to the initial study, this colossal creature was about 250 kilometers across and at least 20 kilometers thick. We do not yet know how a creature of such immense size sustained itself, but the leading theory is that it was metabolizing fossil fuels from the planet's crust.\n\nScientists estimate that the creature perished for yet-unknown reasons around 150 000 years ago and has been slowly sinking into the planet's mantle ever since. An expedition inside the creature showed that its internal 'biosphere' is still alive, although barely. The lifeforms found within the dead colossus bear little resemblance to anything found on the surface, leading us to believe that their lineages got separated millions of years ago, which raises further questions about the nature of the colossus.\n\nWe should definitely study this creature further."
